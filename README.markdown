# TRANS.PY :snake: :loud_sound:

***Transcribe audio files! :snake: :loud_sound:***

## ABOUT :books:

I had a project for uni where I had to transcribe a long-ass audio and if you think I'd do this by hand, you're mental. Anyway, because most problems can be solved with code, I tried to solve this one with code too. ***Trans.py*** is that solution. Enjoy! :heart:

## USAGE :hammer:

To use this tool, you need the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.org)
- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)

To download the tool, simply save the file from [this link]().

To use this, you need to have your audio file in the *WAV* format.
You also need to know exactly how long your adio file is in seconds
To transcribe your audio file use the following command.

```bash
python3 trans.py --source yourfile.wav --target output.txt --length 45
```

The command above will transcribe a file by the name of `yourfile.wav` with the length of 45 seconds. Obviously `yourfile.wav` represents your *WAV* file and 45 represents the length of your *WAV* file.
